# Problem 1

The file [IntegerArray.txt](https://github.com/YuxingLiu/Algorithms-Coursera/blob/master/Part1-Week2/IntegerArray.txt) contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the i-th row of the file indicates the i-th entry of an array.
