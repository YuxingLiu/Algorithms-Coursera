NP-complete problems and exact algorithms for them.

## Problem 1

[tsp.txt](https://github.com/YuxingLiu/Algorithms-Coursera/blob/master/Part4-Week2/tsp.txt) is a data file describing a TSP instance. The first line indicates the number of cities. Each city is a point in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single city. The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance --- that is, two cities at locations (x,y) and (z,w) have distance \sqrt{(x-z)^2 + (y-w)^2} between them.

Compute the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour for this instance, rounded down to the nearest integer.
